        // Mine history
        "mineHistory1" => "The open-air museum was opened on May 31, 2012, on the site of the former „Magdalena” oil mine, one of many facilities of this type located in this area (including the „Jantas”, „Zawisza”, „Zawodzie” mines). In the Magdalena - Ropica Polska area, approximately 110 wells were drilled from 1931 to 2000, and approximately 310,000 tons of crude oil were extracted from the deposit. Starting from 1956, further shafts were connected to „Magdalena”, including: mines in Szymbark, including „Bystrzyca”, „Śląsk” and „Lasek”.",
        "mineHistory2" => "In the open-air museum you can see tools, devices, documents and photos related to the history of oil extraction in Poland, especially in the Gorlice Oil Industry Basin. The dominant feature of the complex is the drilling tower from the reconstructed „Ćwiartka” excavation dating back to 1880, from which a panorama of the Beskid Niski Mountains is visible. The exhibition included a reconstruction of the self-outflow of rock oil, which was collected in the so-called besierach or catchers and collected by the so-called scoundrels.",
        "mineHistory3" => "Other valuable exhibits include a drill forge and a hand-held „Granik” device used to extract crude oil through the so-called spooning, „Glinik” type pumping treadmill, boiler and steam pump, Vorthington and Trauzl piston pumps for oil manipulation and pumping, individual pumping crane, JL-1 „Rudno” working elevator with a tripod for drilling wells and tool ramps with a set of drilling tools, instrumentation or machining. A valuable collection of bottles with types of crude oil from various wells in the Podkarpacie region, differing in color, transparency and density.",

        // Oil history
        "oilHistory1" => "The history of searching for natural resources has a very long tradition in the Gorlice region. Already in 1448, three Biecz townspeople received the privilege to search for precious metals, and 9 years later, miners from Żmigród received the same document. The work was most likely carried out in the Beskid Niski Mountains, close to where they lived. In 1530, Seweryn Boner, treasurer of King Sigismund the Old and starosta of Biec, was looking for gold in the Chełm mountain overlooking the town of Ropa. However, he dug not for gold but for oil, which flooded his mine. Due to this event, Boner came to know the saying: He who looked for gold in Oil washed himself with tar. Who could have predicted that in over 300 years, oil would be the most valuable natural resource and would make the area around Gorlice and Galicia famous all over the world.",
        "oilHistory2" => "The first oil mine in this area was opened in 1852 by Prince Stanisław Jabłonowski, on the so-called Empty Forest in Siary. Soon, the prince founded several more shafts and built an asphalt factory in Kobylanka. As it soon turned out, large deposits of raw material were also located near Męcina, Dominikowice, Lipinki, Siary and Gorlice.
        <br>In 1853, Jan Zeh and Ignacy Łukasiewicz managed to obtain kerosene suitable for lighting in Lviv. In the same year, Łukasiewicz moved to Gorlice and worked in a pharmacy. Having access to the raw material, he conducted further research into improving the distillation of oil and was credited with inventing the lamp. In 1854, the first street kerosene lamp in the world was lit in the city.",
        "oilHistory3" => "In the second half of the 19th century, oil extraction and processing in the Gorlice region is gaining momentum, and countless shafts appear in the landscape of the town. In 1883, there were 56 mines operating here. At the same time, refineries were established, the first one was founded in the late 1850s by Countess Jadwiga Straszewska in Lipinki. Count Adam Skrzyński's refinery operated in Libusza from 1872. However, the largest oil processing plant along with a mining tools factory was built in 1883-1885 in Glinik by William Mac Garve and John Bergheim.
        <br>Thanks to oil, Gorlice was so famous that it was here that the Galician Carpathian Oil Company was based here in the years 1877-1893. It was also here that the first industry magazine devoted to the oil industry, „Górnik”, was published in the years 1882-1886.",
        "oilHistory4" => "In 1887, Władysław Długosz appeared in Siary, a figure who became a permanent figure in the Galician oil industry. After initial mining failures and loss of property, he took a job in the company of Mac Garve and Bergheim and left for Borysław. He soon dug up huge deposits of oil there and today he is considered the discoverer of the „oil” Borysław. From then on, his career progressed faster and faster: he was promoted to director of the company's mines, and in the first years of the 20th century he began to establish his own mines. In 1917, he became president of the National Oil Company, a position he held until his death. At the same time, his political career was developing - in 1908 he became a member of the National Parliament of Galicia, then in 1911 he was nominated Minister for Galicia, and in free Poland he was a senator.",
        "oilHistory5" => "Oil extraction and processing in the vicinity of Gorlice has left permanent traces to this day. In many towns (including Lipinki, Kryg, Biecz, Kobylanka) you can still see characteristic mine stones. The „Magdalena” oil museum was established in Gorlice. Many exhibits related to the oil industry are located in the PTTK Regional Museum in Gorlice, in the private oil museum of the Pabis family in Libusza and in Zagroda Maziarska in Łoś. Those interested in the topic can also visit places related to the founders of the oil industry - the Długosz Palace in Siary, the Długosz family mausoleum in Sękowa, the pyramid-shaped Skrzyński tomb in Zagórzany. The Carpatho-Galician Oil Route runs through the district. The Oil Run is organized every year, attracting an increasing number of participants. Finally, local names are associated with oil - Ropa, Ropica, Ropki.",
